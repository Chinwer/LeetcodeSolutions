/*
 * 1104. Path In Zigzag Labelled Binary Tree
 *
 * In an infinite binary tree where every node has two children,
 * the nodes are labelled in row order.
 *
 * In the odd numbered rows (ie., the first, third, fifth,...),
 * the labelling is left to right, while in the even numbered rows
 * (second, fourth, sixth,...), the labelling is right to left.
 *
 * Given the label of a node in this tree, return the labels in the
 * path from the root of the tree to theÂ node with that label.
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 * 1 <= label <= 10^6
