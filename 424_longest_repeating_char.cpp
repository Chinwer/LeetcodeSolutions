/*
 * 424. Longest Repeating Character Replacement
 *
 * Given a string sÂ that consists of only uppercase English letters, you can perform at most k operations on that string.
 * In one operation, you can choose any character of the string and change it to any other uppercase English character.
 * Find the length of the longest sub-string containing all repeating letters you can get after performing the above operations.
 *
 * Note:
 * Both the string's length and k will not exceed 104.
